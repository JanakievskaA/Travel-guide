INSIDER TIP: Skip the elevator lines by taking the stairs to the 2nd floor - it's 674 steps but the line moves 3x faster. The champagne bar on top is overpriced (€15 for a small glass), but the view makes it worth it once.
SECRET SPOT: The best free view of the tower is from Trocadéro gardens across the Seine - arrive 30 min before sunset for golden hour photos.
LOCAL HACK: Buy tickets online exactly 60 days in advance at 8:30 AM Paris time - that's when they release new dates and sell out within hours.

LOCAL HACK: Stand across the street at "Plaça de Gaudí" (small park with pond) for reflection photos of the full basilica.
WHAT TO KNOW: Gaudí is buried in the crypt (included in ticket). He was hit by a tram in 1926 and mistaken for a homeless man - no taxi would take him to hospital.
ARCHITECTURE TIP: The columns inside are designed like tree trunks - Gaudí studied forests for 10 years. Count the "knots" where branches split.

Barcelona – Park Güell:

LOCAL HACK: The fresh fruit cups (€2-3) at the market entrance are tourist traps. Walk to the middle stalls for same quality at half price.
WHAT TO SKIP: The living statue performers often demand €5 after you photograph them. The flower stalls are 3x more expensive than local florists.

ANTIQUE MARKET: Last Sunday of each month, 400+ stalls line the canals. Arrive early (08:00) for best finds.
WHAT TO KNOW: The canals once connected Milan to Lake Como and Switzerland. Da Vinci designed the lock system that's still visible.
NIGHTLIFE: The area transforms after 22:00 into Milan's bar and club scene. More relaxed and cheaper than central city clubs.

=== LISBON ===

Lisbon – Belém Tower:
16th-century fortified tower that guarded Lisbon's harbor. Symbol of Portugal's Age of Discoveries.
PRACTICAL INFO: Ticket €8. Hours: 10:00-17:30 (summer until 18:30). Closed Mondays.
INSIDER TIP: Buy combined ticket (€12) with Jerónimos Monastery - saves €3 and both are in Belém. Visit monastery first, then tower.
SECRET SPOT: The rooftop terrace has panoramic river views, but the narrow spiral staircase gets crowded. Go at opening or 30 min before closing.
LOCAL HACK: Walk along the waterfront promenade from the tower to the MAAT museum (1.5km) for modern architecture and river views.
NEARBY: Pastéis de Belém (10-min walk) invented the famous Portuguese custard tarts in 1837. Queue is long but moves fast. €1.30 each.
HISTORY: Vasco da Gama and other explorers departed from this spot for voyages to India, Brazil, and beyond.

Masterpiece of Manueline architecture, built to celebrate Vasco da Gama's voyage to India.
PRACTICAL INFO: Church: free. Cloisters: €10. Hours: 10:00-17:30 (summer until 18:30). Closed Mondays.
INSIDER TIP: The church is free and contains Vasco da Gama's tomb. The paid cloisters are worth it for the intricate stone carvings - maritime symbols everywhere.
SECRET SPOT: The upper choir loft in the church offers a bird's-eye view of the nave. Stairs near the entrance, rarely used.
LOCAL HACK: Visit the Archaeological Museum in the west wing (same building, €5) - far less crowded than the cloisters with interesting exhibits.
WHAT TO KNOW: The monastery took 100 years to build (1501-1601). The stone carvings include ropes, anchors, and armillary spheres celebrating Portugal's maritime power.
PHOTOGRAPHY: Morning light through the cloister arches is magical. Best photos from the fountain in the center.

Lisbon – Alfama District:
Medieval Moorish neighborhood with winding alleys, fado houses, and Lisbon's most authentic atmosphere.
PRACTICAL INFO: Free to explore. Best times: morning for photos, evening for fado music.

SECRET SPOT: Miradouro de Santa Luzia has azulejo tile walls and the best view of Alfama rooftops and the river. Free.
LOCAL HACK: Tuesday and Saturday mornings, the Feira da Ladra (Thieves' Market) has everything from antiques to junk. Bargain hard.

WHAT TO EAT: Ginjinha (sour cherry liqueur) from A Ginjinha bar (€1.50 a shot). Drink it in the street like locals.

Lisbon – Tram 28:
Vintage yellow tram rattling through Lisbon's historic neighborhoods - a tourist attraction that's also real public transit.
PRACTICAL INFO: Regular transit ticket: €3. Day pass: €6.60. Runs 06:00-23:00.
INSIDER TIP: Board at Martim Moniz terminus (not Praça do Comércio) to get a seat. Then ride the full loop through Alfama, Graça, and Baixa.
SECRET SPOT: The section through Graça neighborhood (less touristed) has the best views and authentically residential feel.
LOCAL HACK: BEWARE of pickpockets - the crowded tram is notorious for them. Keep bags in front, hands on valuables.
WHAT TO KNOW: These 1930s trams navigate streets designed for horse carts. The sharp turns and steep hills are half the experience.
ALTERNATIVE: The Gloria and Bica funiculars are shorter rides but equally photogenic and less crowded.

Lisbon – Time Out Market:
Historic Mercado da Ribeira transformed into Lisbon's premier food hall with 40+ vendors and communal dining.
PRACTICAL INFO: Hours: 10:00-24:00 (Fri-Sat until 02:00). Budget €15-25 for a meal.
INSIDER TIP: The quality is high (curated by Time Out magazine) but so are prices. Share dishes with friends to taste more.
SECRET SPOT: The upstairs bar has river views and cocktails - less crowded than downstairs and more relaxed atmosphere.
LOCAL HACK: Come for lunch (12:00-14:00) when locals eat - faster service than dinner crowds. Or late night (after 22:00) for drinks.
MUST-TRY: Seafood at "Marisqueira Azul", steak sandwich at "Café de São Bento", pastéis de nata everywhere.
BUDGET ALTERNATIVE: The traditional market section (west side) sells fresh produce, cheese, and bread at normal prices. Buy ingredients and picnic by the river.

LOCAL HACK: The Great Court Restaurant on the upper floor of the central dome has afternoon tea with rooftop views (£20-40) - fewer crowds than the main café.
CONTROVERSY: The museum won't return the Elgin Marbles to Greece or the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. Worth reading about before visiting.
MUST-SEE: Mummy of Katebet (room 63) - 3,000 years old, so well-preserved you can see her fingernails.

London – Tower of London:
1,000 years of history: fortress, palace, prison, and home of Crown Jewels. Anne Boleyn was executed here.
PRACTICAL INFO: Ticket £34.80. Hours: 09:00-17:30. Include 1-hour Beefeater tour (free with entry, every 30 min from entrance).

SECRET SPOT: The Chapel of St. John (White Tower, 2nd floor) is the oldest church in London - Norman architecture from 1080. Rarely crowded.

INSIDER TIP: Skip the packed front gates for guard change. Stand at the Guards Museum side (Birdcage Walk) - you're 5 meters from the marching soldiers.
SECRET SPOT: Walk through Green Park to the palace - more peaceful than The Mall. The Canada Gate (opposite palace) has best photography angles.
LOCAL HACK: The Royal Mews (£15) - the royal stables - has the actual golden carriages used for coronations. Never crowded.
WHAT TO KNOW: If the flag is raised, the monarch is home. If "Royal Standard" flag (not Union Jack), they're definitely in residence.

London's oldest food market (1,000+ years). Now a foodie paradise with 100+ traders.
PRACTICAL INFO: Hours: Wed-Sat 10:00-17:00. Closed Sunday-Tuesday. Most crowded Saturday lunch.

SECRET SPOT: The Brindisa stall (Spanish imports) has €15 charcuterie plates with the best jamón outside Spain.
LOCAL HACK: Come at 16:00 - traders discount items they can't sell next day. End-of-day cheese deals are legendary.
BUDGET TIP: Get free samples at the cheese stalls by asking questions. The olive oil vendors give generous tastings.
NEARBY: Walk 5 minutes to Maltby Street Market (Saturday only) for the same quality with 1/10 the crowds. Waffle with duck and fig (£9) is iconic.

SECRET SPOT: The Gloriette (hilltop monument in gardens) has a rooftop café with palace and Vienna views. €4.50 entry, worth every cent.

INSIDER TIP: Climb the South Tower for the best city views. The North Tower has an elevator but less impressive views.
SECRET SPOT: The catacombs contain plague victims and Habsburg intestines (hearts are at Augustinian Church, bodies at the Kapuzinergruft). Dark but fascinating.
LOCAL HACK: Attend a Sunday mass (10:15 AM) for free organ music and choir - even if you're not religious, the acoustics are incredible.
PHOTOGRAPHY: The colorful roof tiles are best seen from the North Tower or from Stephansplatz square below.
WHAT TO KNOW: The "Riesentor" (Giant's Door) is the main entrance - named for a giant bone (actually mammoth) that hung there in medieval times.

Vienna – Belvedere Palace:
Two baroque palaces housing Austria's most important art collection, including Klimt's "The Kiss."
PRACTICAL INFO: Upper Belvedere (where The Kiss is): €16. Combined ticket: €26. Hours: 09:00-18:00 (Fri until 21:00).
INSIDER TIP: "The Kiss" is in the Upper Belvedere, Room 24. Go there first, then work backward. The painting is surprisingly small but stunning.
SECRET SPOT: The Lower Belvedere has fewer crowds and beautiful temporary exhibitions. The orangery hosts concerts in summer.
LOCAL HACK: The palace gardens are free and perfectly manicured. Walk uphill from Lower to Upper Belvedere for the iconic framed view of the palace.
ART HIGHLIGHTS: Besides Klimt, see Egon Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka, and French Impressionists.
PHOTOGRAPHY: "The Kiss" allows photography. Frame it with the ornate gold frame for best effect. The garden view of Upper Belvedere is classic Vienna.
